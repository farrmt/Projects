<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This work was done with <a href="http://inr.oregonstate.edu/people/david-green">Dr. David Green</a>, the <a href="http://www.holekamplab.org/">Holekamp lab</a> along with <a href="https://www.afwelsite.com">Dr. Gary Roloff</a> to quantify the impact of anthropogenic disturbance and management alternatives on the carnivore community within the Masai Mara National Reserve (MMNR), Kenya. Carnivore communities in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, including the MMNR, are among the most diverse in the world, but human-wildlife conflict threatens the continuation of this community. To understand the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the carnivore community, we compared two disparate management regions within the MMNR that are managed by separate entities. The Mara Triangle experiences minimal disturbance while the Talek region contains high frequency of human-wildlife conflict. Using a hierarchical multi-species distance sampling model we estimate the community wide and species-specific effects of the Talek region on carnivore abundance and compared species’ abundances and group sizes between regions.</p>

<div id="background" class="section level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This was my first project as a graduate student, but the idea for this research originated before I started at Michigan State University. My part in this project began when I visited MSU as a prospective student for the <a href="https://msu.edu/user/ezipkin/">Zipkin Quantitative Ecology Lab</a>. Elise (Dr. Zipkin) encouraged me to talk with members of her department where I met Dr. Kay Holekamp for the first time. At the time I was finishing a job as a field technician and looking for work. Coincidently, Kay was in need of a technician for her Mara Hyena Project. In less than a month I was on a plane headed to Nairobi, Kenya to begin an 8 month safari in the Masai Mara National Reserve.</p>
<p><img src="/Projects/img/HMSDS_01.JPG" /></p>
<p><img src="/Projects/img/HMSDS_02.JPG" /></p>
<p>Prior to my departure, Elise and I discussed the possiblility of using long-term data from Kay’s project for my dissertation research. So while I was primarily working on Kay’s project (monitoring the behavioral ecology of spotted hyenas), I was also keeping my eyes open for a potential interesting research question. During my tenure there, nothing was more obvious than the intensity of human disturbance in the form of tourism and livestock grazing.</p>

<p>Though the presence of disturbance was obvious, I was curious how wildlife were responding inside the Reserve. Upon my return to the States and start of graduate school at MSU, I talked about potential research ideas with David Green, who was a PhD student in Kay’s lab at the time. Dave had actually spent most of his PhD interested in the effects of human distrubance on widlife. He along with Kay and Dr. Gary Roloff had designed and conducted a distance sampling study between 2012 and 2014 to estimate the abundance of wildlife within the Reserve. Here are photos of a few carnivore species seen during surveys.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a collaboration that took 3.5 more years to get published! Our main finding, unsurprisingly, was that passive managment of wildlife regulations (i.e., prevention of human disturbance) had a negative effect on the carnivore community. But, surprisingly, some species (e.g., spotted hyena, black-backed jackal) actually were more abundant in the presence of disturbance. A reduction in lion abundance due to conflicts with humans is allowing for hyenas and jackals to flourish in the absence of competition. Another hypothesis is that these 2 species are more easily adjusting/adapting to human activities. Either way, communities including this carnivore community often do not responding uniformly to humans or the environment, as such it is important to consider the entire community for either conservation or wildlife management.</p>
<p>This was an extremely beneficial project for me as a new PhD student! Determination and persitance are what got this project done and a few technical pieces that I had to learn along the way. If you’re interested in the statistical side of this project, which I hope you are, keep reading below. And if not… stay tuned for future project blogs!</p>

<div id="modeling-breakdown" class="section level1">
<h1>Modeling Breakdown</h1>
<p>Most of my work for this paper was both estimating the abundance of multiple carnivore species and measuring the effect of management regimes (disturbed vs undisturbed) on the entire carnivore community. We based this off Sollmann et al. 2016.</p>
<p>We used JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler; Plummer 2004) to estimate parameters.</p>
<div id="component-1-binomial-poisson-mixture" class="section level2">
<h2>Component 1: Binomial-Poisson Mixture</h2>
<p>The first component of this model is a binomial-Poisson mixture:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n_{t,j,s} \sim Binomial(N_{t,j,s}, p_{t,j,s})\]</span> <span class="math display">\[N_{t,j,s} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{t,j,s})\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(n_{t,j,s}\)</span> is the recorded number of groups (for non-solitary species; more on this later) or counts (solitary species) during replicate <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of transect <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> for species <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. This is data! <span class="math inline">\(N_{t,j,s}\)</span> is the latent number of groups (non-solitary) or abundance (solitary), <span class="math inline">\(p_{t,j,s}\)</span> is detection probability, and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{t,j,s}\)</span> is the expected number of groups (non-solitary) or abundance (solitary).</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>n[t,j,s] ~ dbin(N[t,j,s], pcap[t,j,s])
N[t,j,s] ~ dpois(lambda[t,j,s])</code></pre>
<p>The binomial part of this mixture is to link what we see/observe in the field to the actual biological process by accounting for imperfect detection. The second part of the mixture is accounting for stochasticity in latent abundance (or number of groups) by describing it as a random Poisson variable.</p>
</div>
<div id="component-2-imperfect-detection-distance-sampling" class="section level2">
<h2>Component 2: Imperfect Detection &amp; Distance Sampling</h2>
<p>This first component is similar to an N-mixture model, but instead of detection probability being estimated from repeated surveys, it is estimated by a detection function using recorded distances. A variety of detection functions exist (see Buckland et al. 1993), but they all have one trait in common, which is that detection probability descreases as a function of distance from the transect.</p>
<p><img src="/Projects/posts/HMSDS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>To calculate detection probability you integrate the detection function to find the area under the curve.</p>
<p><img src="/Projects/posts/HMSDS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>However, we find it more convenient to approximate this integral using distance bins (i.e., multiple rectangles).</p>
<p><img src="/Projects/posts/HMSDS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can then sum up the areas of these rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. The code for this look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g[k,t,j,s] &lt;- exp(-mdpt[k]*mdpt[k]/(2*sigma[j,s]*sigma[j,s]))
pi[k,t,j,s] &lt;- v/B
f[k,t,j,s] &lt;- g[k,t,j,s] * pi[k,t,j,s]</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>g</code> is the height of each rectangle <code>k</code> (<code>t</code> = rep, <code>j</code> = site, <code>s</code> = species) and <code>pi</code> is the width of each rectangle. <code>mdpt[k]</code> is the distance at the midpoint of each class, which is data. <code>sigma</code> is the scale parameter of the half-normal distribution, which we are trying to estimate. <code>v</code> is the length of each distance class (the same for each of the distance classes in our case). <code>B</code> is the transect half-width. We can then sum <code>f</code> up as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pcap[t,j,s] &lt;- sum(f[1:nD,t,j,s])</code></pre>
<p>We now need to link these rectangles to our model to be able to estimate them. We do that by splitting our observations, <span class="math inline">\(n_{t,j,s}\)</span>, into each distance class <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> giving us <span class="math inline">\(y_{k,t,j,s}\)</span>. The vector of observation across distance classes, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y_{t,j,s}}\)</span>, is the realization of a multinomial distribution: <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{y_{t,j,s}} \sim Multinomial(n_{t,j,s}, \mathbf{\pi^c_{t,j,s}})\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\pi^c_{t,j,s}})\)</span> is the vector of detection probabilities at each distance class (not the same pi as above in the code). The key here is that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{y_{t,j,s}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{t,j,s}\)</span> are data, so we can easily estimate <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{\pi^c_{t,j,s}})\)</span>.</p>
<p>JAGS does not allow for latent variable as a parameter of the multinomial distribution, so we use the categorical distribution (See XX Royle). The code for this look like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dclass[i] ~ dcat(fc[1:nD, rep[i], site[i], spec[i]])</code></pre>
<p>This links the distance for each observation to the conditional detection probability, <code>fc</code>. <code>fc</code> is the area of the rectanlge divided by the total area under the curve:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fc[k,t,j,s] &lt;- f[k,t,j,s]/pcap[t,j,s]</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="component-3-group-size" class="section level2">
<h2>Component 3: Group Size</h2>
<p>The next component of our model is for group sizes. Often we see individuals of a certain species within a group. These observations violate the assumption of independence. Thus we aggregate these observation by referring them as a group with a group size greater than 1. We can then model the group sizes separately to estimate an average group size and mulitply it by the number of groups to derive abundance. The code for group sizes is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gs[i] ~ dpois(gs.lambda[s.rep[i], s.site[i], s.spec[i]]) T(1,)</code></pre>
<p><code>gs[i]</code> is the observed group size for a specific observation. We then connect this to the replicate, site, and species. <code>gs.lambda</code> is the average group size for a specific replicate, site, and species.</p>
</div>
<div id="component-4-linear-predictors" class="section level2">
<h2>Component 4: Linear Predictors</h2>
<p>We now have the basic distance sampling structure and can move on to estimating variation in expected abundance (or number of groups). We use the log-link function and a linear predictor made up of covariates explaining variation in abundance.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lambda[t,j,s] &lt;- exp(alpha0[s] + ...)</code></pre>
<p>We can also model variation in group size:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>gs.lambda[t,j,s] &lt;- exp(beta0[s] + ...)</code></pre>
<p>Or detection probability:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sigma[j,s] &lt;- exp(gamma0[s] + ...)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="component-5-community-hyper-distributions" class="section level2">
<h2>Component 5: Community Hyper-distributions</h2>
<p>To make this a multi-species model, we link parameters within each of the linear predictors above using a random effect by species. We allow for each parameter to have a common or community hyper-distribuiton with corresponding hyper-parameters (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\alpha0_s \sim Normal(\mu_{\alpha0}, \sigma_{\alpha0}^2)\)</span>). Using <code>alpha0</code> as an example we code this as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>alpha0[s] ~ dnorm(mu_a0, tau_a0)

mu_a0 ~ dnorm(0, 0.01)
tau_a0 ~ dgamma(0.1, 0.1)
sig_a0 &lt;- 1/sqrt(tau_a0)</code></pre>
<p>This allows information between species to be shared, but we still have species-specific estimates of each parameter.</p>
</div>
<div id="miscellaneous-negative-binomial-as-poisson-gamma-mixture" class="section level2">
<h2>Miscellaneous: Negative Binomial as Poisson-gamma mixture</h2>
<p>A miscellaneous topic that I would like to address is the specificiation of the negative binomial as a Poisson-gamma mixture. We first used a negative binomial for both abundance/number of groups and group size to account for overdispersion. We use a Poisson-gamma mixture, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution#Gamma–Poisson_mixture">alternate specification</a> of the negative binomial. JAGS built-in <code>dnegbin</code> uses the classic specification, but the Poisson-gamma mixture is more convenient for our use. The code for this is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>N[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i]*rho[i])
rho[i] ~ dgamma(r, r)
r ~ dgamma(0.1, 0.1)</code></pre>
<p><code>rho[i]</code> is our dispersion parameter, which is the realization of a gamma distribution. For more information see Greene (2008) or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mcmc-jags/discussion/610037/thread/31ae7acb/">this forum</a> on sourceforge.net.</p>
