<p>I am developing an integrated species distribution model that combines presence only data from opportunistic surveying with distance sampling. Species distribution modeling (SDM) uses ecological covariates and occurrence data to predict a speciesâ€™ distribution. However, SDMs often return biased estimates due to imperfect detection and sampling bias, but model estimates can be improved by integrating more structured sampling into the model. I am working with <a href="http://inr.oregonstate.edu/people/david-green">David Green</a> and the <a href="http://www.holekamplab.org/">Holekamp lab</a> to demonstrate the use of ISDMs by combining presence only data and distance sampling to evaluate human disturbance and apex predator decline on black-backed jackal distribution.</p>
