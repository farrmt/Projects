I am developing an integrated species distribution model that combines presence only data from opportunistic surveying with distance sampling. Species distribution modeling (SDM) uses ecological covariates and occurrence data to predict a species' distribution. However, SDMs often return biased estimates due to imperfect detection and sampling bias, but model estimates can be improved by integrating more structured sampling into the model. I am working with [David Green](http://inr.oregonstate.edu/people/david-green) and the [Holekamp lab](http://www.holekamplab.org/) to demonstrate the use of ISDMs by combining presence only data and distance sampling to evaluate human disturbance and apex predator decline on black-backed jackal distribution.
