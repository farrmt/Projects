<p>The Zipkin lab is collaborating with <a href="https://fwcb.cfans.umn.edu/personnel/todd-arnold">Todd Arnold</a> to use an integrated population model (IPM) to estimate population size and vital rates of the American woodcock (AMWO) using harvest data, band recovery data, and Singing Ground Surveys. We use an IPM framework to integrates multiple datatypes from AMWO and analyze them in conjunction. The results from our IPM reconcile discrepancies in inference from past studies that analyzed these datatypes independently.</p>
