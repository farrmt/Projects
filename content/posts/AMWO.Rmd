## Description
The Zipkin lab collaborated with [Todd Arnold](https://fwcb.cfans.umn.edu/personnel/todd-arnold) to use an integrated population model (IPM) to estimate population size and vital rates of the American woodcock (AMWO) using harvest data, band recovery data, and Singing Ground Surveys. We used an IPM framework to integrate multiple datatypes from AMWO and analyze them in conjunction. The results from our IPM reconcile discrepancies in inference from past studies that analyzed these datatypes independently.
